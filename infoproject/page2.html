            <h2>What Exactly Is Porn Addiction?</h2>
            <p>Pornography addiction—along with sex addiction—isn’t an official diagnosis recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM).¹ That means there’s no definitive porn addiction criteria to guide mental health professionals in diagnosing it.</p>
            <h2>Porn Addiction or Porn Compulsion: Which is It?</h2>
            <p>To date, the studies researchers have conducted on pornography addiction have not given us enough empirical evidence to definitively say: “Hey, this is an addiction disorder! It goes in the same bucket as gambling and alcoholism, and therefore we can treat it the same way.” (Both gambling and substance use, by the way, are recognized mental health diagnoses in the DSM-5).</p>
            <h2>What Happens in the Brain While Watching Porn?</h2>
            <p>One of the clearest indicators of psychological addiction is an emotional response in the brain. Brain activity can be detected via electroencephalography (EEG) which involves placing electrodes on the scalp and measuring the activity. It tells us, from the surface measurements, how active the brain is. We see increased activity whenever people with addiction are presented with images of that addiction—like cigarettes for smokers, or gaming for gamblers. But EEG tests from a pivotal study by UCLA neuroscientists in 2015²showed that people who struggle with porn consumption don’t have this characteristic spike in brain activity while watching porn.</p>
            <h2>I think I am addicted,how can i find hope?</h2>
            <p>You can find hope that many people tried and were victorious in this journey,you just need to keep a positive mindset and have realistic goals towards recovery.</p>
